# About

*Controllers & Stuff* is a compilation of many controllers and other things I've made. 
I'll try to explain most of these things so you can build your own controller from scratch. 
Feel free to comment on any project on my discord server [https://discord.gg/fknwz8s](https://discord.gg/fknwz8s)

# SOUND VOLTEX CONTROLLERS

## Sound Voltex Simple Edition (SVSE) style controller

These are instructions to make a 49x25x10cm controller to play Soundvoltex on your computer.

The controller is made out of MDF wood and acrylic on top and on the sides. It includes both knobs and 7 buttons spaced like an arcade.

# BEATMANIA IIDX CONTROLLERS

### Beatmania IIDX DJDAO FPS-style controller

This is the first controller I made. The measures for the controller and the buttons were really hard to get. I took information from various chinese blogs and some from the DJDAO website until I came with what the controller is now. The only thing that bothers me with this design is the turntable, because it's made using a rotary encoder instead of an optic encoder like DJDAO's, mostly because those parts are harder to get and are a little more expensive. Still, the turntable works great.

### Beatmania MINI-IIDX (?)

WORK IN PROGRESS (as of 05-26-2017)
Prototype of mini Beatmania controller. Using the original buttons with a smaller box and a turntable that's not a turntable but should work almost the same. Also I will keep the Arcade TT distance of 80-90 milimeters.

### Beatmania & Soundvoltex Hybrid controller (incomplete)

This is an incomplete failure of a controller. I tried to make a controller that could play both Sound Voltex and Beatmania IIDX, but at the same time it could change from 1P to 2P. Well the mess inside the controller was too much so I finished up scraping the project andit just became a normal IIDX controller, no hybrid whatsoever.

The controller is pretty much the same as the Beatmania controller, but the keypad has holes for 2 extra FX buttons and 2 knobs.

# OTHER CONTROLLERS

### Simple and small Arcade controller

This is a simple controller made with only available stuff from the internet, no custom circuit boards or extra soldering. This is as easy as it gets.
